Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  this is a branch of computer science that develops,tests and maintain softwares.
  reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications 
 scalability and flexibility -  ensures  systems can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection  like authentication, authorization and encryption to make user information secure .

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering process
mastering complexity
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - indentifies the main scope of the software
analysis - has the final user specification. 
design - creating the blueplints of how the softwate is supposed to. 
coding - this is the acutal writing of algorithims are procudures
 testing -the coded software is coded
 maintaining- maintainace of the software happens at this stage,,ading modules or updating


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - develops applications using programing languages
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- - maintains and updates software. 
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- sees if the software meets the requirement 
Project Manager - lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
helps in coding languages and offers many enviroments.eg visual studio
version is the current update of the ide eg visual sudio 5.45

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time Constraints - Software engineering  can have tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows.
 -rapid technological advancement.
 Solution: adopting continuous with the changing world -
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes.
solution- adopt with current upgrades ,software and hardware

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - consists in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
- it ensures that each unit functions correctly
 Integration tests - ensures that different modules work well together.
 - ensures data flows smoothly between modules.
 System testing -deals with the entire software.
 assists to make sure the system is okay
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
if where you guide AI prompt to have desired output
improves user experience by providing the desired results

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
this is
